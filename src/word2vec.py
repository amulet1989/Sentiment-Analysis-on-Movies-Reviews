    This function takes a list of tokenized text documents (corpus) and a pre-trained
    Word2Vec model as input, and returns a matrix where each row represents the
    vectorized form of a document.

    Args:
        corpus : list
            A list of text documents that needs to be vectorized.

        model : Word2Vec
            A pre-trained Word2Vec model that will be used to vectorize the corpus.

        num_features : int
            The size of the vector representation of each word. Default is 100.

    Returns:
        corpus_vectors : numpy.ndarray
            A 2D numpy array where each row represents the vectorized form of a
            document in the corpus.
